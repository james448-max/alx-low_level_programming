INTRODUCTION TO THE PROJECT

-> README.md
-> All files are available for use but credit must be given the owner of this REPO as courtesy demands.

PROGRAMMING QUOTES
-> “Assembly, while extremely powerful, is simply too difficult to program large applications and hard to read or interpret in a logical way. C is a compiled language, which creates fast and efficient executable files. It is also a small "what you see is all you get" language:” ― Wiki Books, C Programming

-> “Unlike most computer languages, C allows the programmer to write directly to memory. Key constructs in C such as structs, pointers and arrays are designed to structure, and manipulate memory in an efficient, machine-independent fashion.” ― Wiki Books, C Programming

CONCLUSION
-> ALX is preapring us for the future and we are absolutely happy and grateful for it.
